LPC FW Ver. 102++ LED meanings.		2019-11-04 KSTR

LA (green)	: GPIO2[10] "lpc_dbg_led_m0_hb"		M0 Core Heartbeat (fast)
LB (green)	: GPIO2[11] "lpc_dbg_led_m4_hb"   	M4 Core Heartbeat (slow)
LC (green)	: GPIO2[12] "lpc_dbg_led_audio_ok"	On when there are continuously incoming midi events (or overriden)
LD (yellow)	: GPIO2[13] "lpc_dbg_led_task_ovfl"   	On when "Task Overflow" (calls to some tasks are still pending when next scheduling is due)
LE (red)	: GPIO2[14] "lpc_dbg_led_error"		On when traffic to ePC or BBB is stalled


Notes:
"Audio OK" is the output of a retriggerable monoflop with a 120ms timeout.
It is retriggered by incoming midi over USB events.
Output state can be forced/overriden by helper functions.
Depending on the monflop state the duty cycle of a 10Hz-square-wave is changed.
The square-wave is brought out to a pin which is connected to the Supervisor (for detection).


"Task Overflow" is always indicated when a preset is changed!
The offending task seems to be NL_GPDMA_Poll() which is due every 125uS and gets overrun during a
preset change. Overruns higher than 2 pending calls did not occur in a short test I made,
so this problem seems to be minor, if any.
It might affect (micro-)timing because the task scheduler tries to catch up any calls it could not
make at the proper time points later until all pending calls are made.


"Error" is indicated when :
- LPC to BBB transmit FIFO buffer overflows (C15_m4.c, line 108), short indication time
- LPC to ePC USB transmit of midi buffer overruns (nl_tcd_msg.c, line 98), long indication time
